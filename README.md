## Why?

It started as a fun project. I wanted to play around with Elixir/Phoenix and was looking for something cool. Implementing yet another to-do list was kinda boring. Also, who doesn't like simple online games and cat content? ü§≠

## Development

Before setting up the project locally, make sure you have [Podman](https://podman.io/) and Elixir/Erlang on your computer.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:henrikfricke/kitten_pairs
cd kitten_pairs

# Start local postgres database
make postgres

# Install dependencies and run database migrations
make install

# Start server
make start
```

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser. See [Makefile](./Makefile) for more commands.
